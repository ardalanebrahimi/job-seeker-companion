### 🔗 Route Configuration

The routes are configured with lazy loading for optimal performance:

```typescript
// V4 Routes in app.routes.ts
{
  path: "v4-demo",
  loadComponent: () => import("./features/v4-demo/v4-demo.component")
},
{
  path: "applications/:id/interview-hub", 
  loadComponent: () => import("./features/interview-hub/interview-hub.component")
},
{
  path: "applications/:id/company-brochure",
  loadComponent: () => import("./features/company-brochure/company-brochure.component")
},
{
  path: "companies/:id/brochure",
  loadComponent: () => import("./features/company-brochure/company-brochure.component")
}
```

### ✅ Route Parameter Handling

Both components now properly handle:
- **Route parameters**: Automatically read `id` from URL path
- **Input parameters**: Support programmatic component usage
- **Fallback behavior**: Graceful handling when no ID is provided
